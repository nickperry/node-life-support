Thanks for your interest in contributing!

Please follow these simple guidelines to get your change accepted quickly:

- Open an issue first for non-trivial changes or design discussions.
- Fork the repository, create a branch named `fix/...` or `feat/...` and submit a PR.
- Write tests for new behavior where applicable. Keep changes small and focused.
- Maintain code style consistent with the project (Go formatting: `gofmt`).
- For changes that alter public behavior, update README and add a changelog entry.

We use GitHub PR reviews for merging. CI checks (tests, linters) will be required before merge.
